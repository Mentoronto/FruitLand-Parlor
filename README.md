# FruitLand Parlor
This app is a work in progress for our future fruits and vegetables store that will be launching in the near future. It includes a customer side option to order some of our products that include fruits/vegetables and shakes while also including a admin/manager side that can login and manually add or remove products without having to change any code. The goal for this project is to make a shopping experience as smooth and easy as possible for both the customer and the owner.

### Overview
- This Project is a Nextjs App paired with MongoDB and the Redux toolkit.
- This app uses an external Api that allows an admin user to add or remove products in a easy fashion and also checking the status of current orders.


# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
